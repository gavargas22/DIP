 "SpaMathemtical technique for spearating an image into spatial frequency \
components.. Since images can be considered two spatial dimension of spatial \
dimensions. There fore image have also a spatial frequenc and we can do some \
things in the frequency domain easier than we can in the spatial domain, \
things such as convolutions.\n\n\nA bit more mathmatically speaking\n\nFor \
images a 1D function is just a row and columns, a complete subset of roes and \
columns\n\nUpper case letters deonte images. lowecase letters denote \
position.\n\nAveraging in 1 dimention. if we have an input image I we average \
the value stored at each location  and the values next to it. the result at \
location ii in the output image J\n\nBasically the most important concept is \
the Kernel, this is a location that produces a mathematical function where \
the inout is the values surrounding it. This is the concept of the \
nieghborhood\n\nBoundary COnditions\n\nWhat do we do when the neighborhood \
part does not exist. There are a  couple of strategies\n\n",
